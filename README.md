# H1B-Sponsorship

As an international student who just started the Master of Science in Business Analytics, I have an ultimate goal of finding a data analyst job within the US. Past experience told me that I have liked the atmosphere and style of start-ups better. However, I have also heard a lot that with limited resource, start-ups tend not to hire international students who need H1B sponsorship. In addition, the uncertainty of COVID-19 made the US job market more unstable. Thus began my research: What is the H1B application like when taking company size into consideration? Do titles give a huge difference in salary? What are my best chance to land a job in the US?

In order to answer my question, I utilized the technique of web scraping on H1B Salary Database, as well as hierarchical clustering. In the notebook, I demonstrated how I used these techniques to answer my own question.
